// Rust Ownership rules:
// Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
// There can only be one owner at a time.
// When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

fn give() {
    let a = String::from("hi");
    
    let still_a = print_and_back(a);
    // println!("{}", a) // unable to access moved value here

    // now the string hi is gone (was dropped in take())
